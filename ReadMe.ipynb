What does that mean? *High-level* implies that as a JavaScript developer, you don't need to bother with intricate system operations like memory management. *Dynamically typed* suggests that variables can take on various types during execution; if you believe it's a duck now, it might become a beaver later. And *multipurpose* indicates its versatility in various platforms and applications.\n", "\n", "JavaScript's notable trait is its omnipresence on the web.

While traditionally JavaScript was a client-side language, Node.js is a runtime that enables JavaScript to run server-side. How? Node.js uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine to execute your JavaScript code outside the browser. When your JavaScript code runs in Node.js, it can interact with the system, manage files, and even serve web requests. This extends JavaScript's reach to a full-stack language, making it possible for developers to use one language for both the client and server side. \ud83d\ude0e"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "source": ["## Understanding Your Grader Than Workspace Files\n", "\n", "Welcome to your Grader Than Workspace!

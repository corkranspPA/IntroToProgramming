    "# Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In many programming languages, we need to classify the type of data we are\n",
    "working with so that the computer can understand us better. In JavaScript, there\n",
    "are six basic, or **primitive**, data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals and negative numbers: 2, 4, 2.5, -3791, 39.99.\n",
    "- String: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces,\n",
    "  symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes \" ... \".\n",
    "  You'll often hear me calling it 'text' to keep things simple.\n",
    "- Boolean: This data type only has two possible values ‚Äî true and false (without quotes). It‚Äôs helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù question.\n",
    "- Null: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword null (without quotes).\n",
    "- Undefined: This data type is denoted by the keyword undefined (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null. undefined means that a given value does not exist.\n",
    "- Symbol: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers,\n",
    "  useful in more complex coding. We won't see these in this course!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these primitive types, there are also **objects**, which are\n",
    "collections of related data.  They are more complex, but we'll be learning\n",
    "plenty about them as we go along.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Strings and Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do that, though, let's get more\n",
    "comfortable with strings and numbers, which are likely the data we will be\n",
    "working with the most. Check out the code cell below üëá."

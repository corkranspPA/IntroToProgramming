    "# Unit Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be\n",
    "logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, that is a\n",
    "function, a subroutine, a method or property.  You won't be required to write\n",
    "your own unit tests, although you will be offered the opportunity to take\n",
    "advantage of them for some of our assignments!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Jest\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need to install a testing package.  We will be installing jest\n",
    "with the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the terminal - press ``control+` `` on your keyboard.  `` ` `` can be\n",
    "   found right above tab, to the left of 1.  You can also open the menu at the\n",
    "   top left of the page and select `View -> Terminal`.\n",
    "2. Type `npm install jest` and press `Enter` on your keyboard\n",
    "3. In [package.json](/home/developer/Documents/code/package.json), add the\n",
    "   following code right above \"dependencies: {}\" :\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "    \"scripts\": {\n",
    "      \"test\": \"jest\"\n",
    "    },\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. package.json should look like the image below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"/home/developer/Documents/code/IntroToProgramming/img/pkgJSON.png\"\n",
    "width=\"450\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything looks good, keep reading.  If not, contact me over email or Webex\n",
    "for help!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Jest\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the `Testing Demo` folder, which has two files: `testing.js` and\n",
    "`testing.test.js`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### testing.js\n",
    "\n",
    "First, take a look at `testing.js`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function areaOfRect(length, width) {\n",
    "    return length * length;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "exports.areaOfRect = areaOfRect;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To take advantage of unit testing, we must **export** any function we want to\n",
    "test.  Exporting will always take the form of `exports.functionName =\n",
    "functionName;` - easy enough, so far!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### testing.test.js\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's take a look at `testing.test.js`.  Unit testing will always take place in a file\n",
    "named `fileName.test.js`, where `fileName` is the name of the file you want to\n",
    "test.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const testing = require('./testing.js');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To test a javascript file, it must first be **imported**.  The name of the\n",
    "variable can be whatever you want, but a safe choice is to just use the\n",
    "filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at one of the tests written in the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "test('correct area - 4 x 6', () => {\n",
    "    expect(testing.areaOfRect(4, 6)).toBe(24);\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There's some new syntax here, but the basic idea still comes across.  This test\n",
    "**expects** that if we call our `areaOfRect` function, which is in our `testing`\n",
    "object, with the arguments `4` and `6`, the result is going **to be** `24`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other tests in the file, all written with differences in\n",
    "arguments and expected results. At the bottom, there are even tests that use\n",
    "randomly generated values and loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Unit Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests are run from the JavaScript console (or 'terminal'), which may or may not\n",
    "be visible to you right now.  If it isn't, press ``control+` `` on your\n",
    "keyboard.  `` ` `` can be found right above tab, to the left of 1.  You can also\n",
    "open the menu at the top left of the page and select `View -> Terminal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"/home/developer/Documents/code/IntroToProgramming/img/terminal.png\" width=\"450\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To run unit tests, use the following command syntax: `npm test filename.test.js`\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"/home/developer/Documents/code/IntroToProgramming/img/testCmd.png\" width=\"450\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The tests will be executed, and any failed tests will have additional info provided.\n",

    "<img src=\"/home/developer/Documents/code/IntroToProgramming/img/testResults.png\" width=\"450\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "See if you can get all of the tests to pass!"

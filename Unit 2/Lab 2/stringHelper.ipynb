    "index of a character in the original string (i.e. `n` will be in the range\n",
    "0..str.length-1 (inclusive)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- missingChar(\"kitten\", 1) → \"ktten\"\n",

    "\n",
    "### middleThree\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string of odd length, return the string length 3 from its middle, so\n",

    "## Testing your work\n",
    "\n",
    "To check your work for this lab, use `npm test stringHelper.test.js` in the\n",

    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Right click your stringHelper.js file in the explorer to the left, then select\n",
